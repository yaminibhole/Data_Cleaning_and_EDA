# PRODIGY_DS_TASK2
This repository contains code for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using the 'train.csv' file. The dataset includes information about passengers such as their survival status, class, age, and other attributes.

## Overview
- `Task2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning and EDA.
- `train.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

Data Cleaning and EDA
The Task2.ipynb notebook includes step-by-step code for:
1. Loading the 'train.csv' dataset
2. Handling missing values
3. Exploring basic statistics
4. Visualizing the distribution of numerical features
5. Exploring survival rates
6. Analyzing survival by class, sex, and age
7. Creating visualizations for better understanding
8. Generating a correlation heatmap
